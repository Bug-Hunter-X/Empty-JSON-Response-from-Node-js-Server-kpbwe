# Empty JSON Response from Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server unexpectedly returns an empty JSON response instead of the intended data.  The problem is identified and a solution is provided.

## Problem

A simple Node.js HTTP server is designed to return a JSON response. However, it consistently sends an empty JSON object `{}`, even when data should be included.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the appropriate data is passed to the `response.end()` method to be sent as part of the JSON response. The corrected code adds this necessary data to fix the issue.
